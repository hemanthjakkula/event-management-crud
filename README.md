# User Creation, Events CRUD, Authentication and Authorization

### This project helps the user to create the account for Eventmanagement.

### Once account created the user can CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE their respective events.

### When a Signup a token is generated(AlphaNUmeric with Length 15), When User loggedin the token is stored in his local storage.

### For every request user sends to server a Authorization token added in Header.

### To guess the token of another user would be very difficult.

### In our PHP Script after verifying the token, It allows the request to be completed.

### User can also Download their events.

### Please check DataProvider.js and AuthProvider.js Files for API calls and Authoorization.
